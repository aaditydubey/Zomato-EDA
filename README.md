# Zomato Bangalore Restaurants Data Analysis

## Introduction
* This is an Exploratory Data Analysis Project on Zomato Banglore restaurants. The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurant at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant, Bengaluru being one such city has around 50,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world. Bengaluru being an IT capital of India. Most of the people here are dependent mainly on the restaurant food as they donâ€™t have time to cook for themselves.
* The analysis can be done using the data, by studying the factors such as:Location of the restaurant, approx Price of food, theme based restaurant or not, which   locality of that city serves that cuisines with maximum number of restaurants , the needs of people who are striving to get the best cuisine of the neighborhood, etc.

## Conclusion

Based on my analysis keeping restaurant business in mind. I tried to figure out answers to some of the common queries when opening any new restaurant.

* Maximum number of restaurants don't have Booking Table Facility (around 80 %). New Restaurant can get the competitive advantage if they provide Bookin Table Facility.

* Providing online ordering can boast your chances.

* Pubs and bars, Drinks & nightlife and Buffet types of restaurants have higher ratings.

* BTM, Koramangala, HSR are good places to start restaurant. Koramangala, Indiranagar, BTM are most popular locations among foodies.

* North-Indian, North-Indian & Chinese and South Indian Cuisines are the most popular cuisines.
