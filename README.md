# Zomato Bangalore Restaurants Data Analysis

## Introduction
* This is an Exploratory Data Analysis Project on Zomato Banglore restaurants. The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurant at different places in Bengaluru. Bengaluru being one such city has around 50,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world. Bengaluru being an IT capital of India. Most of the people here are dependent mainly on the restaurant food as they donâ€™t have time to cook for themselves.
* The analysis can be done using the data, by studying the factors such as:Location of the restaurant, approx Price of food, theme based restaurant or not, which   locality of that city serves that cuisines with maximum number of restaurants , the needs of people who are striving to get the best cuisine of the neighborhood, etc.
